      <t>This document specifies additions and amendments to <xref target="RFC4462">SSH
      GSS-API Methods</xref>. It defines a new key exchange method that uses SHA-2 for
      integrity and deprecates weak DH groups. The purpose of this specification is to
      modernize the cryptographic primitives used by GSS Key Exchanges.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC4462">SSH GSS-API Methods</xref> allows the use of
      GSSAPI for authentication and key exchange in SSH. It defines three
      exchange methods all based on DH groups and SHA-1. The new methods
      described in this document are intended to support environments that
      desired to use the SHA-2 cryptographic hash functions.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Rationale">
      Due to security concerns with SHA-1 <xref target="RFC6194"/> and with
      MODP groups with less than 2048 bits <xref target="NIST-SP-800-131Ar1"/>
      we propose the use of the SHA-2 based hashes with DH group14, group15,
      group16, group17 and group18 <xref target="RFC3526"/>. Additionally we
      add support for key exchange based on Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman with
      NIST P-256, P-384 and P-521 as well as X25519 and X448 curves.
      Following the rationale of <xref
      target="draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-kex-sha2-01"> only SHA-256 and SHA-512
      hashes are used.

    <section title="New Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange methods">
      <t>In <xref target="RFC5656"/> new SSH key exchange algorithms based on
      Elliptic Curve Cryptography are introduced. We reuse much of section 4
      to implement GSS-API-authenticated ECDH Key Exchanges.</t>
      <t>Additionally we utilize also the curves defined in <xref
      target="draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-curves-00"/> to complement the 3 classic
      NIST defined curves required by <xref target="RFC5656"/>.</t>

      <section title="Generic GSS-API Key Exchange with ECDH">
        <t>This section reuses much of the scheme defined in Section 2.1 of
        <xref target="RFC4462"/> and combines it with the scheme defined in
        Section 4 of <xref target="RFC5656"/>; in particular, all checks and
        verification steps prescribed in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC5656"/>
        apply here as well.</t>

        <t>The symbols used in this description conform to the symbols used in
        Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC4462"/>. Additionally, the following
        symbols are defined:</t>
        <t>Q_C is the client ephemeral public key octet string</t>
        <t>Q_S is the server ephemeral public key octet string</t>

        <t>The Client:</t>
        <t>1. C generates an ephemeral key pair with public key Q_C</t>
        <t>2. C calls GSS_Init_sec_context(), using the most recent reply
        token received from S during this exchange, if any. For this call,
        the client MUST set mutual_req_flag to "true" to request that mutual
        authentication be performed. It also MUST set integ_req_flag to "true"
        to request that per-message integrity protection be supported for this
        context. In addition, deleg_req_flag MAY be set to "true" to request
        access delegation, if requested by the user. Since the key exchange
        process authenticates only the host, the setting of anon_req_flag is
        immaterial to this process. If the client does not support the
        "gssapi-keyex" user authentication method described in Section 4 of
        <xref target="RFC4462"/>, or does not intend to use that method in
        conjunction with the GSS-API context established during key exchange,
        then anon_req_flag SHOULD be set to "true". Otherwise, this flag MAY
        be set to true if the client wishes to hide its identity. Since the
        key exchange process will involve the exchange of only a single token
        once the context has been established, it is not necessary that the
        GSS-API context support detection of replayed or out-of-sequence
        tokens. Thus, replay_det_req_flag and sequence_req_flag need not be
        set for this process. These flags SHOULD be set to "false".</t>
        <list>
          <t>If the resulting major_status code is GSS_S_COMPLETE and the
          mutual_state flag is not true, then mutual authentication has
          not been established, and the key exchange MUST fail.</t>

          <t>If the resulting major_status code is GSS_S_COMPLETE and the
          integ_avail flag is not true, then per-message integrity
          protection is not available, and the key exchange MUST fail.</t>

          <t>If the resulting major_status code is GSS_S_COMPLETE and both
          the mutual_state and integ_avail flags are true, the resulting
          output token is sent to S.</t>

          <t>If the resulting major_status code is GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED,
          the output_token is sent to S, which will reply with a new
          token to be provided to GSS_Init_sec_context().</t>

          <t>The client MUST also include Q_C with the first message it
          sends to the server during this process; if the server
          receives more than one Q_C or none at all, the key exchange
          MUST fail.</t>

          <t>It is an error if the call does not produce a token of non-
          zero length to be sent to the server. In this case, the key
          exchange MUST fail.</t>
        </list>

        <t>3. When a Q_C key is received, S verifies that the key is valid.
        If the key is not valid the key exchange MUST fail.</t>

        <t>4. S calls GSS_Accept_sec_context(), using the token received from
        C.</t>
        <list>
          <t>If the resulting major_status code is GSS_S_COMPLETE and the
          mutual_state flag is not true, then mutual authentication has not
          been established, and the key exchange MUST fail.</t>

          <t>If the resulting major_status code is GSS_S_COMPLETE and the
          integ_avail flag is not true, then per-message integrity protection
          is not available, and the key exchange MUST fail.</t>

          <t>If the resulting major_status code is GSS_S_COMPLETE and both
          the mutual_state and integ_avail flags are true, then the security
          context has been established, and processing continues with step
          5.</t>

          <t>If the resulting major_status code is GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, then
          the output token is sent to C, and processing continues with step
          2.</t>

          <t>If the resulting major_status code is GSS_S_COMPLETE, but a
          non-zero-length reply token is returned, then that token is sent to
          the client.</t>
        </list>

        <t>5. S generates an ephemeral key pair with public key Q_S and performs
        the following computations:</td>
        <list>
          <td>K a shared secret obtained using Q_C and Q_S.</td>

          <td>H = hash(V_C || V_S || I_C || I_S || K_S || Q_C || Q_S ||
          K).</td>

          <td>MIC is the GSS-API message integrity code for H computed by
          calling GSS_GetMIC().</td>
        </list>

        <t>6. This step is performed only if the server's final call to
        GSS_Accept_sec_context() produced a non-zero-length final reply
        token to be sent to the client and if no previous call by the
        client to GSS_Init_sec_context() has resulted in a major_status of
        GSS_S_COMPLETE. Under these conditions, the client makes an additional
        call to GSS_Init_sec_context() to process the final reply token.
        This call is made exactly as described above. However, if the
        resulting major_status is anything other than GSS_S_COMPLETE, or a
        non-zero-length token is returned, it is an error and the key exchange
        MUST fail.</td>

        <t>7. C verifies that the key Q_S is valid. If the key is not valid
        the key exchange MUST fail.</t>

        <t>8. C computes the shared secret K and H the same way it is done in
        step 5. It then calls GSS_VerifyMIC() to check that the MIC sent by S
        verifies H's integrity. If the MIC is not successfully verified, the
        key exchange MUST fail.</td>

        <td>If any GSS_Init_sec_context() or GSS_Accept_sec_context() returns
        a major_status other than GSS_S_COMPLETE or GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, or
        any other GSS-API call returns a major_status other than
        GSS_S_COMPLETE, the key exchange MUST fail. The same recommendations
        expressed in Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC4462"/> are followed with
        regards to error reporting.</td>
